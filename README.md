 A game that takes place in a virtual arena where programs written in a simplistic language fight one another. They attempt to stop each other by overwriting instructions that are about to be executed.  We explored the design of a VM (with the relevant instructions, records, etc.) and challenges related to compiling an assembly language into bytecode.
